        <p>
          Excitement is one of the most natural human reactions that occurs in various situations such as victory or defeat. Excitement is actually the response of our mind and body to an important event; a response that can include joy, anger, sadness, excitement, or even silence and coldness.
        </p>

        <p>
          But is excitement a bad thing? In fact, no. Excitement is an inseparable part of being human. Without excitement, there will be no motivation for effort and progress. However, when excitement gets out of control, it can lead to wrong decisions and psychological or physical damages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Excitement has two main types: <strong>positive excitement</strong> and <strong>negative excitement</strong>. Positive excitement includes feelings like joy, satisfaction, motivation, and hope that lead to growth, focus, and better performance in the athlete. On the other hand, negative excitement such as anger, jealousy, despair, or fear can destroy focus and reduce sports performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          When experiencing excitement, our body starts secreting several important hormones. During positive excitement, hormones like <strong>dopamine</strong> (feeling of pleasure), <strong>serotonin</strong> (feeling of calm), and <strong>endorphin</strong> (natural feeling of joy) are secreted. But during negative excitement or severe stress, hormones like <strong>adrenaline</strong> and <strong>cortisol</strong> increase, preparing the body for quick reaction, but if continued, cause fatigue and anxiety.
        </p>

        <p>
          The connection of excitement with negative thoughts is very close. When the athlete's mind after defeat is filled with negative thoughts – like "I lost", "I'm worthless" – negative excitement intensifies and the person becomes angry or desperate. On the other hand, if the person learns to control their thoughts and see defeat as an opportunity for learning, their excitement returns to normal faster.
        </p>

        <p>
          Excitement is also related to anxiety. Anxiety is actually a hidden form of negative excitement that acts more internally. When excitement is not controlled, it may turn into anxiety and disturb the athlete's mind. But if the person learns to identify, name, and manage their feelings, their anxiety also decreases.
        </p>

        <p>
          To regulate excitement after loss or victory, the best way is to recognize your own feelings. You shouldn't run away from excitement, but direct it in the right path. For example, after defeat, it is better to be alone for a few minutes, take deep breaths, and talk to someone you trust. After victory, it is also necessary to manage the joy excitement with calm so as not to become arrogant or unfocused.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Richard Lazarus, one of the founders of emotion psychology, says: <q>Emotions are not our enemies, they just need to be understood and guided.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, a professional athlete is someone who not only exercises their muscles, but also recognizes and controls their excitement. Victory or defeat is only part of the path, but maintaining calm in both situations is a sign of mental maturity and real power.
