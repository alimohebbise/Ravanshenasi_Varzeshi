        <h2>Introduction to Different Body Muscles</h2>

        <img src="biceps.jpg" alt="Biceps Muscle" />
        <p>
          <strong>Biceps Muscle:</strong><br />
          Located in the front of the arm and used for bending the hand. This muscle is strengthened with exercises like dumbbell or barbell curls. It is usually trained along with the triceps to ensure balanced arm growth.
        </p>

        <img src="triceps.jpg" alt="Triceps Muscle" />
        <p>
          <strong>Triceps Muscle:</strong><br />
          Located at the back of the arm and responsible for straightening the hand. Tricep rope exercises and dips are useful for strengthening it. It is better to train it along with biceps.
        </p>

        <img src="shoulder.jpg" alt="Shoulder Muscle" />
        <p>
          <strong>Shoulder Muscle (Deltoid):</strong><br />
          Consists of three parts: front, middle, and back. This muscle gives the body a beautiful shape. Shoulder press and lateral raise exercises strengthen it.
        </p>

        <img src="chest.jpg" alt="Chest Muscles" />
        <p>
          <strong>Chest Muscles:</strong><br />
          They are the front muscles of the body and grow with chest press and fly exercises. These muscles are usually trained along with arms or shoulders.
        </p>

        <img src="back.jpg" alt="Back Muscles" />
        <p>
          <strong>Back Muscles:</strong><br />
          Include several large muscles like latissimus and trapezius. These muscles play a role in pulling movements and body balance. Exercises like pull-ups, deadlifts, and rowing cause their growth.
        </p>

        <img src="abs.jpg" alt="Abdominal Muscles" />
        <p>
          <strong>Abdominal Muscles:</strong><br />
          These muscles provide body stability and proper shape. Plank and sit-up exercises are effective for strengthening them. A healthy diet is essential to see abdominal muscles.
        </p>

        <img src="legs.jpg" alt="Quadriceps Muscle" />
        <p>
          <strong>Quadriceps Muscle:</strong><br />
          Located in the front of the leg and used for straightening the knee. Exercises like squats and leg press are useful for strengthening it.
        </p>

        <img src="hamstring.jpg" alt="Hamstring Muscle" />
        <p>
          <strong>Hamstring Muscle:</strong><br />
          Located at the back of the leg and causes knee bending. Exercises like Romanian deadlift and machine leg curl strengthen it.
        </p>

        <img src="gluteus.jpg" alt="Gluteus Muscle" />
        <p>
          <strong>Gluteus Maximus Muscle:</strong><br />
          This muscle is located in the buttocks area and is very important for balance and lower body strength. Squat and Hip Thrust exercises are the best options.
        </p>

        <img src="calves.jpg" alt="Calf Muscles" />
        <p>
          <strong>Calf Muscles:</strong><br />
          Located at the bottom of the leg and cause heel lifting and balance maintenance. To grow them, high repetitions with medium weight should be performed.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #6b2fb3">Muscle Combination Program in Bodybuilding Exercises</h3>
        <p>
          For balanced body growth, coaches usually train muscles in combination:<br /><br />
          🗓 Saturday: Chest and Arms<br />
          🗓 Sunday: Legs and Abs<br />
          🗓 Monday: Back and Triceps<br />
          🗓 Tuesday: Shoulders and Forearms<br />
          🗓 Wednesday: Cardio or Rest<br /><br />
          This division helps all muscles have the opportunity to grow and recover.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: #6b2fb3">Difference Between Muscle Hypertrophy and Strength Gain</h3>
        <p>
          Hypertrophy means the muscle becomes larger; for this goal, train with medium weights and 8 to 12 repetitions. But getting stronger means increasing power, not necessarily size. For strength, train with heavy weights and low repetitions. Nutrition, sleep, and adequate rest are essential in both cases.
