        <p>
          Stress is one of the most common psychological challenges in professional sports. Every athlete, regardless of their skill level or experience, faces psychological pressure in various situations; but the difference between champions and others lies in how they manage stress, not in its absence.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the most important skills for athletes is the ability to control stress at the moment of competition. In these situations, the body usually experiences increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and muscle contraction. To control it, the athlete should practice calming their mind with deep breathing, focusing on the present moment, and using positive internal dialogue. Repeating phrases like "I am ready" or "Control is in my hands" can reduce stress reactions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nutrition plays an important role in the level of stress. Excessive consumption of caffeine, simple sugars, and fatty or processed foods can stimulate the nervous system and increase anxiety. On the other hand, eating fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and adequate water regulates mood and reduces stress responses.
        </p>

        <p>
          The athlete does not live only on the field or in the training hall; they must have psychological peace in all aspects of life. Adequate sleep, healthy communication with family and coach, regular daily planning, and times for mental rest are fundamental factors in long-term stress control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stress is not always bad. A small amount of stress, especially before a competition, can increase motivation and focus. But when stress becomes excessive or distracts the mind from the main performance, it must be controlled. In these cases, breathing exercises, muscle relaxation, and focusing on the execution process (not the result) are essential.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stress can be both positive and negative. The right amount increases focus and motivates; but excessive stress leads to reduced accuracy, technical errors, poor decision-making, and even increased risk of injury. Therefore, the goal is not the complete elimination of stress, but its intelligent management.
        </p>

        <p>
          When stress increases, the body secretes hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which are useful for quick response in the short term, but in the long term cause mental fatigue, reduced focus, and poor decision-making. Excessive stress also negatively affects motor coordination, reaction time, fine muscle control, and self-confidence. As a result, the athlete may not be able to show their real performance in the competition despite extensive training.
