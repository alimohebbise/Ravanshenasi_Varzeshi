        <h2>Self-Esteem in Sports</h2>

        <p class="meta">
          Abstract — Self-esteem is one of the fundamental components of mental health in athletes and affects their performance, motivation, and resilience. This article discusses the definition of self-esteem in the sports context, factors that make athletes vulnerable, and strategies to strengthen self-esteem.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to physical benefits, sports have important psychological functions; however, the pressure of competition, comparison, and external judgment can threaten athletes' self-esteem. In this article, self-esteem is defined as the individual's sense of worthiness without solely depending on sports results.
        </p>

        <h3>Athletes' Vulnerability to Self-Esteem Decline</h3>
        <p>
          Research shows that athletes are at risk of self-esteem decline due to the characteristics of the sports environment and society. Key factors include:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Dependence on Results</h3>
        <p>
          Defining an individual's value based on win or loss causes every failure to reinforce feelings of inadequacy and reduced personal value. This dependence also weakens the ability to recover after defeat.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Constant Comparison with Others</h3>
        <p>
          The competitive space directs the athlete's mind to continuous comparisons with teammates or rivals. Unbalanced comparisons can lead to feelings of inequality and reduced self-confidence.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Media Pressure and Appearance Judgment</h3>
        <p>
          Media and social networks often highlight the athlete's appearance and lifestyle. This focus on appearance can create unrealistic expectations and lead to body anxiety and reduced self-esteem.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Athletes who define their value based on performance or body appearance are more vulnerable to injuries and failures." — Dr. James Duffy, Sports Psychologist
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Not Tying Overall Success to Sports</h3>
        <p>
          One of the principles of sports psychology is separating the individual's identity and value from sports results. Sports success is part of identity, not all of it. Emphasizing the process (effort, learning, and discipline) instead of focusing solely on the result helps psychological resilience.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "When my competitions ended, I felt I had no value anymore. I realized I had to know myself beyond the results." — Michael Phelps
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Self-Acceptance as a Prerequisite for Growth</h3>
        <p>
          Self-acceptance means respecting and valuing oneself in any situation, not being satisfied with the current status. Self-acceptance creates the foundation for healthy behaviors for improvement and prevents negative motivation based on hatred of the body or performance.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "I love my body as it is; because this body has led me to success." — Serena Williams
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Being Happy for Others' Success and Focusing on Personal Growth</h3>
        <p>
          The ability to be happy for others' success is a sign of healthy self-esteem. Seeing others' progress as a source of inspiration, rather than a threat, strengthens healthy competition and internal motivation.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "If a player plays better than me, I'm happy; because it makes me want to get better." — Cristiano Ronaldo
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Self-Coaching</h3>
        <p>
          Empowering the athlete to guide, constructively criticize, and encourage themselves in the absence of a coach is a factor in maintaining self-esteem. Positive internal dialogue and realistic goal-setting are skills that should be taught and practiced.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Every day I asked myself what I had done to get better today? This internal dialogue was my real coach." — Kobe Bryant
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Practical Strategies for Strengthening Self-Esteem in Sports</h3>
        <p>
          1. Separating Identity from Results: Emphasizing learning and process rather than just results. 2. Recording Progress: Keeping a goal notebook and recording small progress instead of focusing solely on major results. 3. Variety in Training: Preventing monotony and increasing motivation by changing the program or training environment. 4. Strengthening Positive Internal Dialogue: Teaching reflective and self-encouragement techniques. 5. Social Support: Facilitating positive communication between athlete and coach and creating an encouraging space. 6. Media Management: Reducing negative effects of social networks and focusing on real and personal goals.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Self-esteem plays a central role in mental health, motivation, and sports resilience. Athletes who build their value from within and separate dependence from results and appearance are more resilient against failures and pressures. Self-acceptance, drawing inspiration from others' success, and cultivating self-coaching skills are among the most important practical strategies for maintaining and strengthening self-esteem on the sports path.
