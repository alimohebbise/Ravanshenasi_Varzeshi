        <p>
          <strong>What is Anxiety?</strong><br />
          Anxiety is a state of worry, tension, or fear that usually arises without real danger outside the mind. In sports, anxiety occurs when an athlete fears the outcome, judgment from others, or potential mistakes in the future. In fact, anxiety is a mental and physical reaction to a situation that the individual perceives as threatening, even if it isn't in reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>What is the difference between anxiety and stress?</strong><br />
          Stress is usually the body's natural response to real external pressure; like workout pressure or competition. But anxiety is a mental and anticipated reaction that can occur even before the event happens. In short:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stress comes from outside (like workout or competition pressure).</li>
          <li>Anxiety comes from within (negative thoughts, fear of failure).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>What hormones are secreted during anxiety?</strong><br />
          In conditions of anxiety, the body secretes hormones such as <b>adrenaline</b> and <b>cortisol</b>. These hormones prepare the body for "fight or flight" mode: heart rate increases, breathing quickens, and muscles contract. Although in the short term it can increase focus, if it persists, it leads to fatigue and decreased performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>What foods increase anxiety?</strong><br />
          Some foods and drinks stimulate the nervous system and increase anxiety, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>☕ Excessive caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, strong tea)</li>
          <li>🍬 Sugar and artificial sweets</li>
          <li>🍟 Fatty and fried foods</li>
          <li>🧃 Carbonated drinks</li>
          <li>🍫 Excessive chocolate (especially dark with high percentage)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          On the other hand, consuming fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, and low-fat dairy products helps reduce anxiety.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>What is beneficial anxiety?</strong><br />
          Beneficial anxiety or "motivational anxiety" is a level of worry that increases focus and readiness. A few examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An athlete who is a bit anxious before a competition and this increases their focus.</li>
          <li>A runner who converts pre-start heart palpitations into energy.</li>
          <li>A footballer who has more accuracy in passes due to constructive anxiety.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>What is harmful anxiety?</strong><br />
          When anxiety becomes excessive, it disrupts mental and physical performance. A few examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A basketball player who hesitates at the moment of shooting due to fear of error.</li>
          <li>A swimmer who suffers from severe stomach pain and palpitations before a race.</li>
          <li>A weightlifter who thinks too much about others' judgment and loses focus.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Words from sports greats about anxiety:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          🗣 <b>Michael Phelps:</b> "I always have anxiety before a race, but I've learned to use it for better focus."<br /><br />
          🗣 <b>Alex Ferguson:</b> "Anxiety means caring. A player who has no anxiety has no motivation."<br /><br />
          🗣 <b>Naomi Osaka:</b> "Anxiety is a natural part of the growth path. Every time I face it, I become stronger."<br /><br />
          🗣 <b>Muhammad Ali:</b> "I was afraid before every match, but I turned fear into energy."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong><br />
          Anxiety is not the athlete's enemy; rather, it's a message from the mind saying "something is important to you." If we recognize and control it, it can turn into a force of focus and motivation. But if we let it go, it can hinder growth and success. The goal is not to eliminate anxiety — but to manage it properly.
